## Brief Biography of Pei-Yuan Wei

<img width="174" height="217" alt="Pei-Yuan Wei" align=right src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/604a54f3-5ef0-4100-9230-9f04de3830c2" />

Pei-Yuan Wei (Chinese: 魏培源; Pinyin: Wèi Péiyuán) was a Taiwanese-American computer specialist, creator of ViolaWWW, one of the first popular graphical web browsers.[^1][^2]

### Birth and Education
- Born in Taiwan, Pingtung County.[^1]
- Graduated from Berkeley High School (California, USA) in 1986.[^1]
- Received a bachelor's degree from the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley).[^1]
- Was a member of the student club XCF (eXperimental Computing Facility) — a group engaged in experimental technologies.[^1]

### Career and Technological Contributions
- In 1989, became acquainted with HyperCard from Apple, which inspired him to create graphical interfaces.[^3]
- In 1990, developed Viola — a visual object-oriented programming language for X Window System (Unix).[^3]
- In 1991–1992, created ViolaWWW — the first browser with support for scripts, styles, and interactive elements.[^3][^4]
- In the 1990s, worked on developing Viola, collaborated with O'Reilly Media, and founded Global Network Navigator (GNN) — one of the first Internet businesses with advertising.[^1]
- After 2008, lived between Taiwan and the USA, devoting time to caring for an ill family member.[^1]

### Correspondence with Tim Berners-Lee (1991)

On December 9, 1991, Tim Berners-Lee (the inventor of the World Wide Web) welcomed Pei Wei to the www-talk mailing list. In this historic email, Pei Wei expressed his interest in the WWW project:[^6]

> *"I'm now browsing through parts of the WWW distribution, and I'm seeing lots of potential in it. It seems that the only browser is for the NeXT, a platform most people don't have access to, which is a shame."*
>
> *"I'm now seriously considering writing an X11 browser for HTML files by extending a program I've been working on (called VIOLA, a program somewhat like HyperCard)..."*

Tim Berners-Lee responded enthusiastically:

> *"Ok.. sounds like a good idea. [...] Anyone who makes a good X11 W3 browser will be very popular."*

This correspondence marks the beginning of ViolaWWW development as a web browser and demonstrates the collaborative spirit of the early web community. Tim Berners-Lee offered to share CERN's alpha-test code, including the HTML SGML parser, to help with the project.

### Recognition by Tim Berners-Lee

Tim Berners-Lee spoke about Pei Wei in glowing terms in his book "Weaving the Web" and in numerous interviews.[^7] In his address at CERN in 1998, upon accepting a fellowship, he said:

> *"It's worth saying that I feel a little embarrassed accepting a fellowship when there are people like Pei Wei ...[who] read about the World Wide Web on a newsgroup somewhere and had some interesting software of his own; an interpreted language which could be moved across the NET and could talk to a screen.. in fact what he did was really ahead of his time."*[^7]

### Death
- Died in 2023 at the age of 54.[^2]
- The Computer History Museum noted his contribution as a pioneer of the web.[^2]

## ViolaWWW: History and Significance

ViolaWWW is a discontinued web browser developed based on the Viola language. Released in 1991–1992 for Unix systems with X Window System.[^4]

### Technical Innovations
ViolaWWW was the first browser with:
- **Scripts and Styles**: Supported a scripting language (predecessor to JavaScript) and simple style sheets (predecessor to CSS).[^4]
- **Interactive Elements**: Forms, tables, client-side document insertion, sidebar panel for meta-information.[^4]
- **Architecture**: Viola (not ViolaWWW) was an Object Oriented programming language and a bytecode VM. The ViolaWWW browser was a VM application — the "killer app" that made most people care about the Viola platform.[^3][^7]

### Historical Significance
- Recommended by CERN (where the WWW was invented) as the best browser at the time.[^4]
- Mentioned in Ed Krol's book "Whole Internet User's Guide and Catalog" (1992).[^4]
- **Direct inspiration for Mosaic**: When Marc Andreessen was shown ViolaWWW, it helped inspire him to start an effort at NCSA that would become Mosaic.[^7]
- Became a model for Mosaic, Netscape Navigator, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome.[^3][^4]
- Involved in patent disputes (Eolas vs. Microsoft, 1999–2012): recognized as "prior art", which saved the web from monopoly on interactivity.[^4][^5]

### Challenges and Limitations
Despite its technical advantages, ViolaWWW had a critical flaw: it was hard to get working. Users had to install the Viola runtime (the VM) first and then run the browser within that runtime. Getting it set up and running proved problematic even for technically savvy people. There were issues with permissions and bugs, and Pei Wei was working on the project largely alone.[^7] This difficulty in setup ultimately allowed Mosaic — which prioritized ease of installation across multiple platforms — to gain wider adoption.

### Why Valuable for Tech Enthusiasts
ViolaWWW is a bridge between the textual era of the web (Line Mode Browser) and the graphical (Mosaic). It showed how a browser could be a platform for code execution, not just a viewer. Without it, there would be no modern web applications.

For further study: source code is stored in the Computer History Museum, CERN archives.[^2] ViolaWWW is a key artifact in the history of computing and the web.
