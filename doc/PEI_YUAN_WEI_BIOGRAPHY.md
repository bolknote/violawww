<img width="174" height="217" alt="Pei-Yuan Wei" align=right src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/604a54f3-5ef0-4100-9230-9f04de3830c2" />

Pei-Yuan "Perry" Wei (Chinese: 魏培源; Pinyin: Wèi Péiyuán) was a Taiwanese-American computer specialist, creator of ViolaWWW, one of the first popular graphical web browsers.[^1][^2][^3]

### Birth and Education
- Born in Taiwan, Pingtung County.[^1]
- Moved to California with his parents in 1980. The family settled two blocks away from the UC Berkeley campus.[^8]
- Graduated from Berkeley High School (California, USA) in 1986.[^1]
- Studied geography at UC Berkeley as "a meeting point between the sciences and the arts," but computing was his true love.[^8]
- Received a bachelor's degree from the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley).[^1]
- Was a member of the student club XCF (eXperimental Computing Facility) — a group engaged in experimental technologies.[^1]
- After graduating in 1991, rather than getting a "real job," Wei continued working at XCF: *"If you made them a proposal they liked, they would let you loose on their computers. That was all the salary Pei Wei needed."*[^8]

### Career and Technological Contributions

#### Creating Viola (1989–1990)
In 1989, HyperCard from Apple caught Wei's eye: *"HyperCard was very compelling back then, you know graphically, this hyperlink thing, it was just not very global and it only worked on Mac,"* he recalls. *"And I didn't even have a Mac."*[^8]

The machines he had access to were X-terminals, which gave him the idea for his project. He got a HyperCard manual and implemented the concepts in X-windows. Rather than taking the direct route of writing a one-off HyperCard-like application in C, Wei chose a more ambitious approach: writing a new computer language, something like Jean-Marie Hullot's Interface Builder but for X-Window instead of NeXT.[^8]

The name **Viola** didn't come from the musical instrument — it was an abbreviation for **"Visually Interactive Object-oriented Language and Application."**[^8] In 1990, that's what Viola became, and the HyperCard-like application was the first thing Wei did with it. In 1991, as Wei was graduating, he released Viola 0.8.[^8]

#### Discovering the World Wide Web
Wei was on the verge of an independent invention of networked hypertext. The question he had to answer was how to transport his Viola pages across the Internet. *"And that's when I read Tim's e-mail about the World Wide Web,"* he explains. *"The URL was very, very clever, it was perfectly what I needed."*[^8]

#### Working at O'Reilly Media
Dale Dougherty at O'Reilly Associates saw the browser: *"so we went to lunch and he hired me."*[^8] Wei's policy of eschewing a real job was paying off — now he had a real job where he could continue to play with computers.

Viola made the task O'Reilly gave Wei easy, so he had plenty of time to keep working on ViolaWWW. O'Reilly was interested in stand-alone electronic versions of its books. With Viola, it took just a few lines of code to put a "button" object on the screen and have it link through to somewhere else.[^8]

#### Later Life
- In the 1990s, worked on developing Viola, collaborated with O'Reilly Media, and founded Global Network Navigator (GNN) — one of the first Internet businesses with advertising.[^1]
- In the late 1990s, worked at the **Internet Archive** (Brewster Kahle's organization).[^3]
- After 2008, lived between Taiwan and the USA, devoting time to caring for an ill family member.[^1]
- Wei donated his Viola design notebooks, software, and video materials to the Computer History Museum.[^3]

### Correspondence with Tim Berners-Lee (1991)

On December 9, 1991, Tim Berners-Lee (the inventor of the World Wide Web) welcomed Pei Wei to the www-talk mailing list. In this historic email, Pei Wei expressed his interest in the WWW project:[^6]

> *"I'm now browsing through parts of the WWW distribution, and I'm seeing lots of potential in it. It seems that the only browser is for the NeXT, a platform most people don't have access to, which is a shame."*
>
> *"I'm now seriously considering writing an X11 browser for HTML files by extending a program I've been working on (called VIOLA, a program somewhat like HyperCard)..."*

Tim Berners-Lee responded enthusiastically:

> *"Ok.. sounds like a good idea. [...] Anyone who makes a good X11 W3 browser will be very popular."*

This correspondence marks the beginning of ViolaWWW development as a web browser and demonstrates the collaborative spirit of the early web community. Tim Berners-Lee offered to share CERN's alpha-test code, including the HTML SGML parser, to help with the project.

### The "One-Night Hack" (December 1991)

Just four days after Tim's reply, Pei Wei told www-talk that he had made a browser. *"It's not very sophisticated at this point,"* he said, *"a one-night hack."* What made it possible to do it so fast was the fact that he had taken the more adventurous approach to writing his HyperCard-like application. All he had had to do was plug the line mode browser code into Viola and he had a rudimentary X-browser.[^8]

*"ViolaWWW works great,"* exclaimed Tim on January 24, 1992. But there was one thing about it that disturbed him: *"A strange thing is,"* he said, *"that it seems to be so fast—a search in the CERN phone book seems to be instantaneous!"* Not only had Pei Wei produced a working X-browser in record time, he had also made it the fastest.[^8]

By May 15, 1992, Pei Wei had got his rewritten ViolaWWW into good shape and Tim wrote a review of it for the growing Web community: *"A very neat browser usable by anyone,"* he said, *"very intuitive and straightforward. The extra features are probably more than 90 per cent of real users will actually use but just the things which an experienced user will want."*[^8]

### Recognition by Tim Berners-Lee

Tim Berners-Lee spoke about Pei Wei in glowing terms in his book "Weaving the Web" and in numerous interviews.[^7] In his address at CERN in 1998, upon accepting a fellowship, he said:

> *"It's worth saying that I feel a little embarrassed accepting a fellowship when there are people like Pei Wei ...[who] read about the World Wide Web on a newsgroup somewhere and had some interesting software of his own; an interpreted language which could be moved across the NET and could talk to a screen.. in fact what he did was really ahead of his time."*[^7]

### Death
- Died in 2023 at the age of 54.[^2]
- The Computer History Museum noted his contribution as a pioneer of the web.[^2]

## ViolaWWW: History and Significance

ViolaWWW is a discontinued web browser developed based on the Viola language. Released in 1991–1992 for Unix systems with X Window System.[^4]

### Technical Innovations
ViolaWWW was the first browser with:
- **Scripts and Styles**: Supported a scripting language (predecessor to JavaScript) and simple style sheets (predecessor to CSS).[^4]
- **Interactive Elements**: Bookmarks, back/forward buttons, history feature, forms, tables, client-side document insertion, sidebar panel for meta-information.[^4][^8]
- **Architecture**: Viola (not ViolaWWW) was an Object Oriented programming language and a bytecode VM. The ViolaWWW browser was a VM application — the "killer app" that made most people care about the Viola platform.[^3][^7]
- **Applets (Mini-Applications)**: By May 1993, ViolaWWW could run programs. Wei came up with "mini-applications" — applets to all intents and purposes: a network traffic monitoring graph, a chessboard where you could move pieces, a chat application that let you send text AND draw things, applications for remote computation, and a drawing tool called xplot. *"Two years later Sun released the Java language, complete with applets, to great fanfare, but Pei Wei had been there first."*[^8]

### Wei's Vision

*"The Web back then was basically like reading a book, a really big book,"* explains Wei, *"but nothing was really interactive."* His idea was to add interactivity to the Web so that it actually became the graphical user interface. You wouldn't need to have different programs to do spreadsheets or word processing or surfing the Web — you would do it all in ViolaWWW.[^8]

In Wei's ideal world, *"you would never find a file you couldn't open because you didn't have the right program; the program would just come down the wire along with the information. A click could take you to a program on some other computer that would be loaded into your ViolaWWW browser and run there."*[^8]

### Cross-Licensing with CERN

Tim was really excited about ViolaWWW and started discussions with Pei Wei about cross-licensing software. Wei could make free use of the CERN code and CERN could use Viola as long as neither tried to make a profit at the other's expense. It was an arrangement in the spirit of GNU General Public License and it was just what the Web needed. CERN soon had the ViolaWWW code sitting on the info.cern.ch server free for anyone to download.[^8]

### Historical Significance
- Recommended by CERN (where the WWW was invented) as the best browser at the time.[^4]
- Mentioned in Ed Krol's book "Whole Internet User's Guide and Catalog" (1992).[^4]
- **Direct inspiration for Mosaic**: When Marc Andreessen was shown ViolaWWW, it helped inspire him to start an effort at NCSA that would become Mosaic.[^7]
- Became a model for Mosaic, Netscape Navigator, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome.[^3][^4]
- Involved in patent disputes (Eolas vs. Microsoft, 1999–2012): recognized as "prior art", which saved the web from monopoly on interactivity.[^4][^5]

### End of ViolaWWW Development (March 1994)

The last release of ViolaWWW came in March 1994, because by then a browser called Netscape was taking the Web by storm. *"That's when I threw in the towel and gave up on developing Web browsers,"* says Wei, *"because, you know, they've got this whole company, they're doing a good job, let them do it."* He moved on to other things, but looking back he can't help thinking how things might have turned out differently. *"Boy, would I have loved to have known some technology investors then,"* he sighs.[^8]

### Challenges and Limitations
Despite its technical advantages, ViolaWWW had a critical flaw: it was hard to get working. Users had to install the Viola runtime (the VM) first and then run the browser within that runtime. Getting it set up and running proved problematic even for technically savvy people. There were issues with permissions and bugs, and Pei Wei was working on the project largely alone.[^7] This difficulty in setup ultimately allowed Mosaic — which prioritized ease of installation across multiple platforms — to gain wider adoption.

### Why Valuable for Tech Enthusiasts
ViolaWWW is a bridge between the textual era of the web (Line Mode Browser) and the graphical (Mosaic). It showed how a browser could be a platform for code execution, not just a viewer. Without it, there would be no modern web applications.

For further study: source code, design notebooks, and video materials are stored in the Computer History Museum; code is also available in CERN archives.[^2][^3] ViolaWWW is a key artifact in the history of computing and the web.
