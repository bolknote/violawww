Pei-Yuan Wei (Chinese: 魏培源; Pinyin: Wèi Péiyuán) was a Taiwanese-American computer specialist, creator of ViolaWWW, one of the first popular graphical web browsers.[^1][^2]

### Birth and Education
- Born in Taiwan, Pingtung County.[^1]
- Graduated from Berkeley High School (California, USA) in 1986.[^1]
- Received a bachelor's degree from the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley).[^1]
- Was a member of the student club XCF (eXperimental Computing Facility) — a group engaged in experimental technologies.[^1]

### Career and Technological Contributions
- In 1989, became acquainted with HyperCard from Apple, which inspired him to create graphical interfaces.[^3]
- In 1990, developed Viola — a visual object-oriented programming language for X Window System (Unix).[^3]
- In 1991–1992, created ViolaWWW — the first browser with support for scripts, styles, and interactive elements.[^3][^4]
- In the 1990s, worked on developing Viola, collaborated with O'Reilly Media, and founded Global Network Navigator (GNN) — one of the first Internet businesses with advertising.[^1]
- After 2008, lived between Taiwan and the USA, devoting time to caring for an ill family member.[^1]

### Death
- Died in 2023 at the age of 54.[^2]
- The Computer History Museum noted his contribution as a pioneer of the web.[^2]

## ViolaWWW: History and Significance

ViolaWWW is a discontinued web browser developed based on the Viola language. Released in 1991–1992 for Unix systems with X Window System.[^4]

### Technical Innovations
ViolaWWW was the first browser with:
- **Scripts and Styles**: Supported a scripting language (predecessor to JavaScript) and simple style sheets (predecessor to CSS).[^4]
- **Interactive Elements**: Forms, tables, client-side document insertion, sidebar panel for meta-information.[^4]
- **Architecture**: Based on Viola — a toolkit for visual applications, adapted from HyperCard.[^3]

### Historical Significance
- Recommended by CERN (where the WWW was invented) as the best browser at the time.[^4]
- Mentioned in Ed Krol's book "Whole Internet User's Guide and Catalog" (1992).[^4]
- Became a model for Mosaic, Netscape Navigator, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome.[^3][^4]
- Involved in patent disputes (Eolas vs. Microsoft, 1999–2012): recognized as "prior art", which saved the web from monopoly on interactivity.[^4][^5]

### Why Valuable for Tech Enthusiasts
ViolaWWW is a bridge between the textual era of the web (Line Mode Browser) and the graphical (Mosaic). It showed how a browser could be a platform for code execution, not just a viewer. Without it, there would be no modern web applications.

For further study: source code is stored in the Computer History Museum, CERN archives.[^2] ViolaWWW is a key artifact in the history of computing and the web.
